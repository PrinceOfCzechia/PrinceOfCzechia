- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Petr KrÃ¡l, frequently using the alias @PrinceOfCzechia. My native language is C++ and I do a bit of Java at school too.
- :mag: Iâ€™m interested in Numerical Mathematics and Optimization, currently working on a bachelor thesis utilizing the [TemplateÂ NumericalÂ Library](https://tnl-project.org)'s implementation of Polyhedral Meshes with the aim of improving the accuracy of numerical gradient computation.
- :book: Besides Iâ€™m currently learning Python in my spare time. A cool thing I recently found is the autodiff library [mygrad](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module3_IntroducingNumpy/AutoDiff.html), also to be found on [github](https://github.com/rsokl/MyGrad)
- :envelope_with_arrow: Contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/PrinceOfCzechia), if you feel like.
