- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Petr KrÃ¡l, frequently using the alias @PrinceOfCzechia
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Numerical Mathematics and Optimization, currently working on a bachelor thesis utilizing the [TemplateÂ NumericalÂ Library](https://tnl-project.org)'s implementation of Polyhedral Meshes with the aim of improving the accuracy of computing scalar functions' gradient by slightly continuosly deforming the mesh into a new one, for which known approximations work more accurately
- ðŸŒ± Besides Iâ€™m currently learning Python libraries for Computation and Data Science â€“ NumPy and Pandas
